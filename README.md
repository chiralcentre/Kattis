# Kattis
This archive contains my solutions to Kattis problems, which are mainly in Python 3. <br />
I will be updating this solution archive periodically. <br />
Do contact me at ryan.tan.wj@u.nus.edu if there are any queries, or if you believe a more efficient solution is possible. Any feedback is welcome. <br />
